I made this dictionary app with HTML/CSS/JS, and it uses JSON format data from a free no key API. This app has three functionalities, which are querying, saving, and deleting. After typing in the word, click the Search button, and the definition will show up underneath the input box, if you want to save the definition simply click the save button for later review, and click the button with 'x' to delete the saved definition. If there's a typo or empty input the error and alert message will pop up
